EzAi helps you in coding related work.
When coding in vscode type in the terminal: python EzAi.py

It takes your question and a possible text file you want to add to the question.
The program sends a query and makes the answer viewable in tinker window
The program then sends a second query asking it to simplify the previuous answer ans prints it in the terminal.
This allows simple anwers that can help you while coding while also allowing you to review the long answer given by Gemini
